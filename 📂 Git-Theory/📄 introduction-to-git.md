# Introduction to Git

Git is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development. 
It helps developers work together efficiently by maintaining a complete history of changes.

Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 and is widely used in software projects of all sizes.

## Why Git is Important
- Tracks changes in files
- Allows collaboration among developers
- Helps revert to previous versions
- Prevents loss of code

Git works locally on your computer and does not require internet access for most operations.
