# Branching and Merging in Git

A **branch** is a separate line of development in Git.
It allows developers to work on features independently.

## Why Branching is Useful
- Keeps main code stable
- Enables parallel development
- Makes testing safer

## Merging
Merging combines changes from one branch into another.

Sometimes Git cannot merge automatically, which leads to a **merge conflict** that must be resolved manually.
