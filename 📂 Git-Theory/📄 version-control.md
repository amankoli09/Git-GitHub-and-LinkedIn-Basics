# Version Control System

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that records changes to files over time.

## Benefits of Version Control
- Maintains history of changes
- Allows rollback to older versions
- Helps multiple developers work on the same project
- Improves project organization

## Types of Version Control
- Centralized VCS (example: SVN)
- Distributed VCS (example: Git)

Git is a **distributed** system, meaning every developer has a full copy of the project.
